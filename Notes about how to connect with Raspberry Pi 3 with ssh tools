We now have one HDMI to VGA converter, when have problem, connect the Raspberry to a screen and debug.

1. Connect the wifi AP of Raspberry "RoRaspi", with password "abcdefghijklm"

2. Use SSH tools to connect
	   Username: pi  
	   Hostname: 10.42.0.254 
	   Port: 22
	   password:raspberry
	   
	   
Attention: before you shut down the system, use "sudo halt" or "sudo shutdown -h now" then cut off the power.
